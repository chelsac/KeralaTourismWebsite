      <p class="card-text">
        Kozhikode is a coastal city in the south Indian state of Kerala. It was a significant spice trade center and is close to Kappad Beach, where Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama landed in 1498. The central Kozhikode Beach, overlooked by an old lighthouse, is a popular spot for watching the sunset. Inland, tree-lined Mananchira Square, with its musical fountain, surrounds the massive Mananchira Tank, an artificial pond.
        It is the largest city in the region known as Malabar and was the capital of the British-era Malabar district.

          <p class="card-text"> 
            Kozhikode will always have a special place in the history of Kerala as it is here that Vasco-da-Gama first landed and the legendarySpice Route came into existence. This region still has a historic charm to it. Kozhikode Beach is the personification of the numerous characteristics that make Kozhikode so unique.
            People flock in large numbers to view the sunset from the beach. One gets a fresh supply of seafood in the shacks that surround the place. Kallumekaya (mussels) is a local favourite. A walk to Dolphins Point at dawn ensures a meeting with playful dolphins.
            You are also greeted by a majestic lighthouse and two piers opening into the sea.

          <p class="card-text">
            Quite natural place in kozhikode district of gods own country, well blessed with nature. It is a very unknown, beautiful peak. About 12 km from balusseri. Anyone can get bus to balussery from koyilandi or from kozhikode at any time between 7.00 am and 7.00.pm. &nbsp;Buses are very less to vayalada. So it is better to go with own vehicles. bike is a better option because road after bus stop is not good. Most roads are with rough stones.
            
Dam view point is the main attraction in this place. An amazing View of peruvannamuzhi dam is possible from top of vayada dam view point.
The view is only possible if the climate is good.
